## Introduction
This repository contains notes, solutions, and learnings from my TryHackMe exercises. Each folder represents a room or exercise, and within them, you'll find:
- Step-by-step documentation of my approach.
- Notes on commands and tools used.
- Scripts or configurations applied.
- Screenshots (where allowed) to illustrate key points.

## Skills Demonstrated
Through these exercises, I have developed and demonstrated skills in:
- Linux system administration and command-line tools.
- Vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
- Web application security.
- Network analysis and packet sniffing.
- Basic scripting for automation.
- Incident response and forensic analysis.

## Exercises and Rooms
Here are the exercises included in this repository:
1. **[Fakebank Application Hack](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Tryhackme-exercise/blob/main/Offensive%20Security%20Intro/1.1%20Fakebank%20Application%20Hack.md)**:
    - In this activity, I used a command-line application called Gobuster to perform a brute-force attack on FakeBank's website to uncover hidden directories and pages. Gobuster works by taking a wordlist of potential page or directory names and systematically attempting to access each one. If a match exists on the website, it reports the result, allowing me to identify hidden resources that could be crucial for further investigation. This process enhanced my understanding of directory enumeration and the importance of securing web applications against such attacks.
3. **[Defensive Securty Practical]([./room-name-2/README.md](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Tryhackme-exercise/blob/main/Offensive%20Security%20Intro/1.2%20Defensive%20Security%20Practical.md))**: ....
4. **[Room Name 3](./room-name-2/README.md)**: ....
